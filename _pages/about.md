I am a Data Science graduate student, currently enrolled in the MS in Data Science at New York University [Center for Data Science (CDS)](https://cds.nyu.edu).

I got a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Computer Science at Bocconi University with a thesis focused on Bayesian Machine Learning, advised by Prof. Antonio Lijoi. During my Bachelor's studies, I interned as a Data Analyst over the summer at Barclays in Knutsford, UK. Moreover, I worked for one semester as an undergraduate teaching assistant with Prof. Giacomo Zanella, helping in the production of teaching materials for a course in Applied Stochastic Processes.

This summer I started contributing on research projects focused on Deep Learning and Robotics at the [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/) at NYU. In Fall 2022 I will also work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for a graduate course at NYU CDS.
