I am a Data Science graduate student, currently enrolled in the MS in Data Science at New York University [Center for Data Science (CDS)](https://cds.nyu.edu).

I got a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Computer Science at Bocconi University with a thesis focused on Bayesian Machine Learning, advised by Prof. Antonio Lijoi. During my Bachelor's studies, I interned as a Data Analyst over the summer at Barclays in Knutsford, UK.

This summer I started contributing on research projects focused on Deep Learning and Robotics at the [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (ARPL)](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/) at NYU.
