I am a Data Science graduate student, currently enrolled in the MS in Data Science at New York University [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu). I got a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Computer Science at Bocconi University with a thesis focused on Bayesian Machine Learning, advised by Prof. Antonio Lijoi. During my Bachelor's studies, I interned as a Data Analyst over the summer at Barclays in Knutsford, UK. Moreover, I worked for one semester as an undergraduate teaching assistant with Prof. Giacomo Zanella, helping in the production of teaching materials for a course in Applied Stochastic Processes.
