I am a Data Scientist currently working at New York Life Insurance Company. 

I got a Master of Science in Data Science at New York University [Center for Data Science (CDS)](https://cds.nyu.edu). Previously, I got a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Computer Science at Bocconi University. During my Bachelor's studies, I interned as a Data Analyst over the summer at Barclays in Knutsford, UK.

This summer I started contributing on research projects focused on Deep Learning at the [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (ARPL)](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/) at NYU.
