Implementation and evaluation of a collaborative-filtering based recommender system with Spark using the MovieLens dataset, with comparison to single-machine implementation and application of approximate nearest neighbor method for accelerated search at query time.

## Abstract
We build and evaluate a collaborative-filtering based recommender system with [Spark alternating least squares (ALS)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.1/ml-collaborative-filtering.html) implementation using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/). We compare the Sparkâ€™s parallel ALS model to [lenskit](https://lkpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) single-machine implementation in terms of efficiency and model performance. Finally, we implement accelerated search at query time using [annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) spatial data structure, and compare this fast search method to the brute force approach in terms of query efficiency and quality of recommendation.
